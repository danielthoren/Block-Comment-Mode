* ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Release 1 (Initial features) ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

** DONE Implement unit tests for all user-level functions
   CLOSED: [2023-05-11 Thu 08:39]
** DONE Where possible, make all variables buffer local (defvar-local)
   CLOSED: [2023-05-11 Thu 08:34]
** DONE Add docstring to all variables
   CLOSED: [2023-05-11 Thu 08:34]

** STARTED Re-format doc strings to conform to GNU standard

* ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Release 2 (stability & cleanup) ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

** TODO Investigate why function 'block-comment--is-comment' is called so many times
   when moving between rows in the block comment
   NOTE: Only function 'block-comment-centering--cursor-moved' should be called.
         Might be a problem with the hooks?

** TODO Look over how local variables are managed:
*** TODO Look over initializations
    Variables are default inited in insert-or-resume after the current
    style has been detected and set. Should this even work?

*** TODO Look over variable defenitions
    should these happen in the define-minor-mode? Now they are
    re-defined regularly in default-init-variables


** TODO Adhere to GNU coding convention
   https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Coding-Conventions.html

** TODO Use chatgtp to improve functions/comments and fix doc style

** TODO Split mode into multiple files

** TODO Fix default style based on prog mode
   Have a list containing cons cells with <prog-mode, style> that is
   used to init the style each time a buffer is loaded. Users can
   append to this list to customize the style.

** TODO Look over startup/config of mode
*** TODO How are other modes started/configured?
    Can we use 'use-package' to init block comment mode?

*** TODO Maybe put insert/resume key-binding in the keymap somehow?
   Should the key-binding for starting/resuming a comment lie in the emacs config file?

* ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Release 3 (Add features) ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

** TODO Make enclose optional in 'block-comment--init-comment-style'
       and make mode adhere to that

** TODO Auto detect if row uses centering
       If the amount of space on both sides of the user text is equal,
       or off by 1, assume that centering should be used

** TODO implement offset between top enclose body and bottom enclose

** TODO Add Toggling Between Different Lengths of block comments

** TODO Implement automatic block comment width detection

** TODO Add automatic row breaking when block comment is longer than 80 characters

** TODO Make block comment width indentation sensative
   Meaning that it does not exceed a strict width limit (80 characters)
